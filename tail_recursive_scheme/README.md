This is a simple tail recursive program written in Scheme that determines 
whether a given list of elements can be considered a palindrome or not.
The function works regardless of the type of the elements of the list. 
The parameter list can contain booleans, numbers, strings and other lists all at the same time 
and the function will work correctly.

To run the code type ``` scheme ozcan_ege.scm``` to the terminal
